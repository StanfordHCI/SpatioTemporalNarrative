SpatioTemporalNarrative
=======================

Exploring stories based around movement through space and time. 

## [Read the annotated code](http://stanfordhci.github.io/SpatioTemporalNarrative/)

We extensively commented the code with explanations and elaborations. We suggest reading it from front-to-back in the order we wrote it - it isn't very much! - so kick it off with the server.js entrypoint! It's rendered in a literate programming style using [docco-husky](https://github.com/mbrevoort/docco-husky).

- #### The node.js server entrypoint is [src/server.js](http://stanfordhci.github.io/SpatioTemporalNarrative/src/server.js.html)

- #### The client entrypoint is [src/public/client.js](http://stanfordhci.github.io/SpatioTemporalNarrative/src/public/js/client.js.html)

## The Interface

When you open the app, you see a list of stories, each incorporating events over time and space:
