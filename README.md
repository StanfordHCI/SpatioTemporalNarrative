SpatioTemporalNarrative
=======================

Exploring stories based around movement through space and time. 

## Reading the code:

We extensively commented the code with explanations and elaborations. We suggest reading it from front-to-back in the order we wrote it - it isn't very much! - so kick it off with the server.js entrypoint!

- #### The node.js server entrypoint is [src/server.js](src/server.js.html)

- #### The client entrypoint is [src/public/client.js](src/public/js/client.js.html)


## Example Narratives:

- [Hunt for the Boston Marathon Bomber Suspects](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/19/us/boston-marathon-manhunt.html?_r=1&)
- [Snowfall, the avalanche](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=descent-begins)
